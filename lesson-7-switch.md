# Lesson 7: Switch

1. Open the "[Switch](https://gobyexample.com/switch)" example and read through it.
2. What is the difference between using Switch and using a bunch of If/Else?
3. Why would you choose Switch over If/Else?

## Challenge

Combine a for loop with switch to count to 10 and print whether the number is less than 5, equal to 5, or greater than 5. The output should look like:

```
1 is less than 5
2 is less than 5
3 is less than 5
4 is less than 5
5 is equal to 5
6 is greater than 5
7 is greater than 5
8 is greater than 5
9 is greater than 5
10 is greater than 5
```

How many different ways can you write your switch cases?
