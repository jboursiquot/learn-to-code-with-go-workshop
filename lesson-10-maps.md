# Lesson 10: Maps

1. Open the "[Maps](https://gobyexample.com/maps)" example and read through it.
2. How are maps like slices, and how are they different?

## Challenge

Write a program that does the following:

1. Creates a map from integers to booleans
2. Loops through the numbers 1 through 10 and sets the map where the key is the number and the value is whether the number is even \(HINT: use an If/Else or Switch!\)
3. Prints out the map -&gt; `map[1:false 2:true 3:false 4:true 5:false 6:true 7:false 8:true 9:false 10:true]`
4. Prints out whether 4 is even using variables -&gt; `The number 4 is even: true`

## Discuss

Share your code with your neighbor, what was different?

What problems did you run into?

## Advanced Challenge

Write a program that sorts a set of numbers 0 - 30 into two groups: "Numbers divisible by 9", "Numbers not divisible by 9". The output for the progrom should something like the output below. `Hint: use constants as map keys.`

```
Divisible by 9: [9 18 27]
Not Divisible by 9: [10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 28 29 30]
```
