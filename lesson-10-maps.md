# Lesson 10: Maps

1. Open the "[Maps](https://gobyexample.com/maps)" example and read through it.
2. How are maps like slices, and how are they different?

## Challenge

Write a program that does the following:

1. Creates a map from integers to booleans
2. Loops through the numbers 1 through 10 and sets the map where the key is the number and the value is whether the number is even \(HINT: use an If/Else or Switch!\)
3. Print out the map -&gt; `map[1:false 2:true 3:false 4:true 5:false 6:true 7:false 8:true 9:false 10:true]`
4. Print out whether 4 is even using variables -&gt; `The number 4 is even: true`

## Discuss
