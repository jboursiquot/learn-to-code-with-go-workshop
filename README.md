# Learn to Code with the Go Programming Language

## Welcome

This material was designed to **introduce programming to complete beginners**. No assumptions are made about prior knowledge or technical proficiency. For this reason, this material is meant to be facilitated in a live workshop setting \(i.e. a [GoBridge](https://golangbridge.org/) workshop\) where teachers and teaching assistants \(TAs\) are on hand to walk through concepts one by one, taking as long as needed to get through the lessons so that students can build confidence in what they're learning.

This guided workshop relies heavily on existing online resources like Go By Example, Go Playground, GoDoc, etc. This guide eases students into language-agnostic concepts like variables, conditionals, looping, etc using the Go language \(aka Golang\).

This material and workshop delivery style originated in part from the work [Johnny Boursiquot](https://twitter.com/jboursiquot) and [Nick Gauthier](https://twitter.com/ngauthier) have done at previous GoBridge workshops. We hope to continue evolving this resource to help the awesome GoBridge community volunteers in their teaching efforts.
