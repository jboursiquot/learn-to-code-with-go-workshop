# Learn to Code with the Go Programming Language

## Welcome

This material was designed to **introduce programming to complete beginners**. No assumptions are made about prior knowledge or technical proficiency. For this reason, this material is meant to be facilitated in a live workshop setting \(i.e. a [GoBridge](https://golangbridge.org/) workshop\) where teachers and teaching assistants \(TAs\) are on hand to walk through concepts one by one, taking as long as needed to get through the lessons so that students can build confidence in what they are learning.

This guided workshop relies heavily on existing online resources like [Go By Example](https://gobyexample.com/), [Go Playground](https://play.golang.org/), [Golang.org](https://golang.org/), [GoDoc.org](https://godoc.org/), and others as needed. This guide eases students into language-agnostic concepts like variables, conditionals, looping, etc and demonstrates their use with the Go language syntax. We cover only the basics here and for the time being, avoid introducing some of the more advanced capabilities of Go \(e.g. goroutines, channels, etc\).

## For Students

You have taken a major step towards learning how to code by signing up for this workshop. If you have never programmed before, you're in the right place. If you have done some programming, perhaps with a different language, some language-agnostic concepts will feel familiar. That said, we will do our best to walk you through everything we'll cover in bite-sized chunks to avoid overwhelming you with details. Our hope is that you will walk away feeling confident to continue this journey on your own.

## Credits

This material and workshop delivery style originated in part from the work [Johnny Boursiquot](https://twitter.com/jboursiquot) and [Nick Gauthier](https://twitter.com/ngauthier) have done at previous GoBridge workshops. We hope to continue evolving this resource to help the awesome GoBridge community volunteers in their teaching efforts.
