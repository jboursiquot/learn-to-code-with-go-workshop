# Learn to Code with the Go Programming Language

## Welcome

This material was designed to **introduce programming to complete beginners**. No assumptions are made about prior knowledge or technical proficiency. For this reason, this material is meant to be facilitated in a live workshop setting \(i.e. a [GoBridge](https://golangbridge.org/) workshop\) where teachers and teaching assistants \(TAs\) are on hand to walk through concepts one by one, taking as long as needed to get through the lessons so that students can build confidence in what they are learning.

This guided workshop relies heavily on existing online resources like [Go By Example](https://gobyexample.com/), [Go Playground](https://play.golang.org/), [Golang.org](https://golang.org/), [GoDoc.org](https://godoc.org/), and others as needed. This guide eases students into language-agnostic concepts like variables, conditionals, looping, etc and demonstrates their use with the Go language syntax. We cover only the basics here and for the time being, avoid introducing some of the more advanced capabilities of Go \(e.g. goroutines, channels, etc\).

## For Students

You have taken a major step towards learning how to code by signing up for this workshop. If you have never programmed before, you're in the right place. If you have done some programming, perhaps with a different language, some language-agnostic concepts will feel familiar. That said, we will do our best to walk you through everything we'll cover in bite-sized chunks to avoid overwhelming you with details. Our hope is that you will walk away feeling confident to continue this journey on your own.

### What you will learn

We'll take our time to make sure you understand the fundamental concepts of programming, including:

* Working with variables and constants
* Working with condition with if/else statements
* Working with lists and looping
* Using functions for reusing functionality
* Using complex types to represent concepts out in the real world
* and so much more in between

### Making the most out of this opportunity

Don't be shy. We're all here to learn. Chances are somebody next to you has the same questions you're afraid to ask. Teachers and TAs are here to help. Speak up whenever you don't understand something.

## For Teachers & Teaching Assistants

Thank you for volunteering your time and expertise to help others learn our craft. Here are some things to keep in mind during the workshop:

1. Patience and empathy are is the best qualities you can bring to the workshop.
2. Do not take over a student's laptop to fix issues for them. Provide verbal instructions and have them perform the work themselves so that they may develop the habit on their own.
3. Make the students feel safe in the space. Avoid using language that may make them feel uncomfortable or inadequate to the task. Encourage them.
4. Report any disruptive elements to the workshop organizer. The goals is to maintain a positive learning environment at all times.

This material and workshop delivery style originated in part from the work [Johnny Boursiquot](https://twitter.com/jboursiquot) and [Nick Gauthier](https://twitter.com/ngauthier) have done at previous GoBridge workshops. We hope to continue evolving this resource to help the awesome GoBridge community volunteers in their teaching efforts.
