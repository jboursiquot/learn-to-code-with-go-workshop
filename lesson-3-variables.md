# Lesson 3: Variables

1. Go back to [https://gobyexample.com](https://gobyexample.com/) and click on the second link, "[Variables](https://gobyexample.com/variables)"
2. Read through the description and the code example
3. Out of all these ways to define variables, which is your favorite, and why?
4. Open the code up on the Go Playground
5. Write the sentence from the last exercise, but this time, use a variable for each CAPITAL
6. What happens if you define a variable with the wrong type? Try it out! 
7. What happens if you try to set the same variable to a different type? Try it out!

For example:

```go
f := "short"
f := 5
```

## Discuss

Why would it be useful to define a variable?

## Challenge

Calculate the sales price for an Under Armour shirt that is 10 USD using the 30% \(\`discount := 0.30\`\) coupon we just received and save it to a variable named \`salePrice\`. 

Then print the sales price using \`fmt.Println\(salePrice\)\`

## Advanced Challenge

Calculate to the sales prices for the same shirt with a discount of 30%, 25%, and 10%. Saving each calculated value into its own variable. 

Print each variable on its own line.
