Lesson 9: Slices

1. Open the "[Slices](https://gobyexample.com/slices)" example and read through it.
2. How are slices different from arrays?

## Challenge

Make a program that does the following:

1. Creates an empty slice of integers and prints it out -&gt; `[]`
2. Loop over the numbers 1 through 10 and appends them to the slice
3. Print out the slice -&gt; `[1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10]`
4. Print out the first 5 numbers in the slice -&gt; `[1 2 3 4 5]`
