# Lesson 5: For Loops

1. Open the "[For](https://gobyexample.com/for)" example and read through it
2. What does the condition for the `for` loop do?
3. What is each part of the "classic" loop?
4. Why would you ever use a loop that never stops?
5. Open the code in the Go Playground
6. Write a program that counts to 10, printing out the numbers 1 through 10
7. Write a program that counts forever! What happens?

## Discuss

## Challenge

Write a for loop that only executes once. 

## Advanced Challenge

Write a loop with no condition that exits when the count is equal to 100.
