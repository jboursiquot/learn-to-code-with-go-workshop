# Lesson 12: Functions

1. Open the "[Functions](https://gobyexample.com/functions)" example and read through it.

## Challenge

Write a program that does the following:

1. Loop through the numbers 1 through 10
2. Call a function that prints out if the number is even or odd \(like in Lesson 11's output\).
3. Refactor your program to add a new function that takes an integer and returns a boolean signifying if the integer is even, use that function inside your printing function.

## Discuss

Share your code with your neighbor, what was different? Why are functions useful?

## Advanced Challenge

Refactor your code so that you end up with a third function. Extra bonus points if you have a function in a function in a function!
