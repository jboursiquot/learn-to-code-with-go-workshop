# Project 1: Quiz Program

We covered a lot of ground with things like variables, conditionals, and looping. In order to help stregthen those concepts we will write a quiz program that displays \(prompts\) a question to the user and waits for the user to enter an input \(response\) to the question being asked. Once all questions have been answered the program should display the total number of questions the user got correct, over the total number of questions asked \(i.e You got 5/6 correct\). 

**Hint**: You will need a type that can hold both the questions and answers as pairs, and the [fmt](https://godoc.org/fmt#Scanln) package for reading input from the screen.

```
What is 5+5? 10
What is 1+1? 2
What is 8+3? 12
What is 1+2? 3
What is 8+6? 14
You got 4/5 correct!
```

The completion of the program is meant to be executed on a local machine running the Go development environment.
