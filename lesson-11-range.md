# Lesson 11: Range

1. Open the "[Range](https://gobyexample.com/range)" example and read through it.

## Challenge

Modify your program from lesson 10 to use a range to iterate the map to output the following:

```
1 is odd 
2 is even 
3 is odd 
4 is even 
5 is odd 
6 is even 
7 is odd 
8 is even 
9 is odd 
10 is even
```

**HINT**: use a `for` loop with `range` to get the key and value of each entry in the `map`, then use an **If/Else** on the value.

## Discuss

When is range useful in a loop instead of the initial/condition/after classic loop style?

## Advanced Challenge

Update the advanced challenge exercise in lesson 10 "Maps" to use a range statement for printing all the groups of numbers.
