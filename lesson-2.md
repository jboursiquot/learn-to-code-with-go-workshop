# Lesson 2: Values
1. Go back to [https://gobyexample.com](https://gobyexample.com/) and click on the second link, "[Values](https://gobyexample.com/values)".
2. Read through the description on the left and the code on the right.
3. Consider the following list of things. What type of value would you use for each one?
   1. The price of a sandwich
   2. The color of a car
   3. The number of people in a class
   4. If it's raining outside
4. For each type `string`, `integer`, `float`, `boolean` come up with your own example and share it with your neighbor.
5. Click the tiny gopher to open the example in the Go Playground.

## Discuss

What kinds of things could you not represent with these four types?

## Challenge

Get your program to print out the following sentence:

`Hi, I'm NAME and I am AGE years old. My favorite color is COLOR and I have $X.XX in my pocket!`

Each time there's something in CAPITALS, use a comma and use the right Go type for that thing. For example:

```go
fmt.Println("My favorite color is ", "blue")
```

## Advanced Challenge

Do the challenge again, this time, using `fmt.Printf and the appropriate format verbs.`

Use the appropriate format verbs to print `The integer value for a, is 97`.
