# Lesson 4: Constants

1. Open the "[Constants](https://gobyexample.com/constants)" example and read through it.
2. What do you think it means for something to be constant?
3. How is this different from a variable?
4. Open the example on the Go Playground and test your hypothesis!

What did you find out?

## Challenge

Go has many constants already defined, for example \`math.Pi\`.

Print out the perimeter distance around a circle that has a radius of 5 feet.

The formula for perimeter distance is `2 * math.Pi * radius`.

## Advanced Challenge

Also output the area of the same circle using the formula: math.Pi * radius<sup>2</sup>
