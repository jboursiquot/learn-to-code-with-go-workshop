# Lesson 6: If/Else

1. Open the "[If/Else](https://gobyexample.com/if-else)" example and read through it
2. What does `%` do?
3. What does `==`, `<`, and `>` do? 
4. What type is the result of using those operators? What type does `if` statements use?

## Challenge

Combine a **For** loop with an **If/Else** to count to 10 and print out if a number is even or odd. The program output should look like:

```
1 is odd
2 is even
3 is odd
4 is even
5 is odd
6 is even
7 is odd
8 is even
9 is odd
10 is even
```

## Discuss

What bugs did you encounter while you were working on the code? What problems did you run into?

## Advanced Challenge

Combine a \`for\` loop with \`if\`, \`else if\` and \`else\` to count to 10 and print whether the number is less than 5, equal to 5, or greater than 5. The output should look like:

```
1 is less than 5
2 is less than 5
3 is less than 5
4 is less than 5
5 is equal to 5
6 is greater than 5
7 is greater than 5
8 is greater than 5
9 is greater than 5
10 is greater than 5
```
