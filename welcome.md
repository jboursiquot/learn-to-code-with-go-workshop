# Learn to Code with the Go Programming Language

## Welcome

This material was designed to introduce programming to complete beginners. No assumptions are made about your prior knowledge or your technical proficiency. For this reason, this workshop is meant to be facilitate in a live workshop setting \(like a GoBridge workshop\) where teachers and teaching assistants are on hand to walk through concepts one by one, taking as long as is needed to get through the lessons so that students can build confidence in what they're learning.
