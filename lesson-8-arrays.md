# Lesson 8: Arrays

1. Open the "[Arrays](https://gobyexample.com/arrays)" example and read through it.

## Challenge

Write a program that does the following:

1. Creates an array of size 10 and print it out -&gt; `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]`
2. Loops through the numbers 1 through 10, and set the value in each slot of the array to the number in the loop
3. Prints out the array `[1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10]`
4. Creates a boolean array of size 10
5. Loops through the first array, and set the second array's value to `true` if the number in the first array is even
6. Prints out the second array -&gt; `[false true false true false true false true false true]`

## Advanced Challenge

Declare an int array of size 5 that is initilized as `[1 0 0 3 0]`

## Discuss

What did you find most challenging about the challenge?

If you print out the type of an array of size 10, what do you expect its type to be?
