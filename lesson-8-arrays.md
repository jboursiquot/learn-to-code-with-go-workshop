# Lesson 8: Arrays

1. Open the "[Arrays](https://gobyexample.com/arrays)" example and read through it.

## Challenge

Write a program that does the following:

1. Create an array of size 10 and print it out -&gt; `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]`
2. Loop through the numbers 1 through 10, and set the value in each slot of the array to the number in the loop
3. Print out the array `[1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10]`
4. Create a boolean array of size 10
5. Loop through the first array, and set the second array's value to `true` if the number in the first array is even
6. Print out the second array -&gt; `[false true false true false true false true false true]`

## Discuss

* What did you find most challenging about the challenge?
* If you print out the type of the int array of size 10 using, what do you expect its type to be?
