Write a program that does the following:

1. Creates an array of size 10 and prints it out -&gt; `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]`
2. Loops through the numbers 1 through 10, and sets the value in each slot of the array to the number in the loop
3. Print out the array `[1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10]`
4. Creates a boolean array of size 10
5. Loop through the first array, and set the second array's value to whether the number in the first array is even
